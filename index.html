        Honestly guys I think you're misunderstanding completely First of all
        I'm not taking it out on you or you guys because I didn't do well I'm
        asking if anything is going to be done after you said you received
        multiple complaints But if you want to twist my words and refuse to help
        that's fine, I will just talk to Rahul myself Thanks for telling me that
        I have a skills issue btw, that really made me feel better I also never
        proposed any solution. I simply asked if you guys are going to take
        action. You said you guys don't know how to proceed. So I said ok, I'll
        just take matters into my own hands because I can't afford to wait for
        you guys to decide. Really disappointed with your reaponse as a
        classmate, but especially as a friend.
